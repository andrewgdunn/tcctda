DO NOT DO ONLINE STD_Y UPDATING;;; FAR WORSE THAN EVEN A GROSSLY OVERESTIMATED STD_Y, WHICH ACTUALLY
HAS NEGLIGIBLE EFFECT ON THE ACCURACY


APPARENTLY THERE EXIST MOMENTARY 'SPIKES' IN THE DATA, PUT ROUTINES THAT LOOK AT THE PARAMETERS TO 
'UNDO' DECISIONS IF THEY BECOME SIMILAR ENOUGH AGAIN IN THE FUTURE (ALWAYS COMPARE CURRENT RUNNING 
AVERAGES TO THE PREVIOUS RESULTS STORED IN RESULTS




Jump Detection
    X sigma rule
        sliding average localization

Jump Confirmation
    1-3 point slope spike past Y sigma of mean


Ramp Detection
            M sigma rule (steep)
                sliding average + center gap localization {{{TOO INACCURATE AVOID IF POSSIBLE}}}
    Periodic R value
        traceback routine
***must base R_period on sensor rate


Ramp Confirmation
    R value of significance
