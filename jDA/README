These are the files that seemed helpful from the DA at the moment:

MyDA2.java -- main file with the callback for the Oracle and Connection
Sensor.java -- a class to store sensor information, a couple of basic methods (std, mean)
ErrorFinder.java -- a class with static methods to look for errors in a given sensor (I thought it might be helpful to separate it out this way in case at some point we want different threads searching for errors or something like that)

compile -- bash script to compile and pack the java files
load.sh -- bash script to load a specific scenario
